```clarity
;; Property: Downtown Apartment
;; Monthly Rent: 2000 STX
;; Total Shares: 100
;; Share Price: 50 STX each
;; Total Investment: 5000 STX

;; Investor Alice buys 10 shares (10%)
;; Cost: 10 × 50 = 500 STX

;; Monthly Distribution:
;; Gross Income: 2000 STX
;; Platform Fee (5%): 100 STX
;; Net Distribution: 1900 STX
;; Per Share: 1900 ÷ 100 = 19 STX

;; Alice's Monthly Income:
;; 10 shares × 19 STX = 190 STX
;; Annual Return: 190 × 12 = 2280 STX
;; ROI: (2280 ÷ 500) × 100 = 456% annually

;; Payback Period: 500 ÷ 190 = 2.6 months
```
